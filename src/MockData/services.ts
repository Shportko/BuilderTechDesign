To successfully maintain this connection of space, it is necessary, first of all, to take into account the characteristics of your site.  Your house and the land on which it stands, the view around, the trees, the water, the shore - everything is connected.  And all this can work for you or against you, depending on how you design the house. ",

          "This can be achieved with elements such as pergolas, awnings, terraces, low landscaped walls, stone paving, skylights, green spaces and others.  It is important to be able to assess the possibilities of using such funds.",

          "Another way to make a connection between the interior and the exterior is to use the so-called.  multi-leaf doors, especially at the corners of the house, where, being fully open, they give the impression of a disappeared wall, and then the interior merges with the exterior with great effect.  True, such door systems are much more expensive than traditional ones, and it is up to you to decide what to give preference to.",

As a result, you have to sacrifice something and find the right balance between the priority needs of the customer, his Wishlist, dreams and real needs.  Further, each room has its own design nuances: for the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and, of course, for dressing rooms",
